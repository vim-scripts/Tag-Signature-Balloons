This is a very simple script that displays the 'signature' of a tag when you hover the mouse over that tag.  Only works if Vim has('balloon_eval') and if there is an available tag file.

Screenshots and the development repository are available on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/abudden/tagsignature
